Name: [Need Action] Migrate cronjob from Apollo Cli C3 Nodes to New Cli on Tess

 

Owners of cronjobs, 

 

Per infrastructure teamâ€™s requirement, we are migrating Apollo Cli from C3 to Tess and you are identified as the owners of the cronjobs currently running on the c3 cli nodes. Please help to migrate your cronjobs from the original c3 nodes to new Tess nodes as we will not automatically migrate the jobs.

 

Please aware the difference of original c3 nodes and Tess nodes based on below E-notify. And the **target end date is 2021-11-15.** If you have any questions or help needed, please find [qinjiang@ebay.com](mailto:qinjiang@ebay.com).
